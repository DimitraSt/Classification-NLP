        "of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all. This is not to say you should never attend \n",

        "even though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first place. It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, \n",
        "and a simple no will be more productive than whatever work the most efficient person can muster. But if the benefits of saying no \n",
        "are so obvious, then why do we say yes so often? We agree to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don't want \n",

        "When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes, you are saying no to every other option. I like how the economist Tim Harford put it, \n",
